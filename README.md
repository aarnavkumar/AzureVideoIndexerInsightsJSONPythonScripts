# AzureVideoIndexerInsightsJSONPythonScripts
A Python script to help you parse Azure Video Indexer's nested JSON output (advanced video and audio option) for conversion into a Pandas DataFrame. Includes a follow-up script describing an actual use case for the DataFrame output.

AzureVideoIndexerGeneralJSONToDataFrameScript.ipynb is a base function that can be used anywhere, and AzureVideoIndexer3DCoordinatesConcatenationScript.ipynb is an extended use case that serves as an example of using the base function. (Original use case is described [here](https://w2.mat.ucsb.edu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=88&t=377&p=2528&sid=d9c3eea3a50afd0ab8409c6b57d98f06#p2528)).

Take the time to understand what each line does before using these scripts. I hope this makes a step or two of the data analytics process easier for you.
